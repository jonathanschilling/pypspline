PyPSPLINE is a Python interface to the Fortran spline library PSPLINE. 

1) Prerequisites

Python (tested for 2.2 and 2.3): http://python.org
NetCDF http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/
PSPLINE: http://w3.pppl.gov/rib/repositories/NTCC/catalog/Asset/pspline.html
NumPy: http://numpy.org/
[optionally f2py: http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/]

A Fortran and C compiler

2) Building PSPLINE

You will need to build PSPLINE first. Download the code from 

wget http://w3.pppl.gov/rib/repositories/NTCC/files/pspline.tar.gz
tar xvfz pspline.tar.gz

You should get 4 directories: pspline, ezcdf, portlib and share. Be sure to set

export FORTRAN_VARIANT = <your_compiler> 

which can be Intel, LaheyFujitsu, Portland, etc. Depending on the location of your netCDF library you
may also have to edit share/Make.flags. Then type 

gmake all.

This will create a directory

LINUX/lib 

or similarly SUN/lib, SGI/lib, etc. on other architectures.

3) Building PyPSPLINE

I recommend to create a directory 

mkdir pypspline/

adjacent to LINUX/. Then type

cd pypspline
gmake all

This will create fpsplinemodule.c. Edit the top lines of the setup.py file and then type

python setup.py install
