PyPSPLINE is a Python interface to the Fortran spline library PSPLINE. 

1) Prerequisites
----------------

Python (tested for 2.2 and 2.3): http://python.org
NetCDF http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/
NumPy: http://numpy.org/
[optionally f2py: http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/]

A Fortran 90 and a C compiler.

I assume the platform to be UNIX. If you manage to build PPSLINE/pypspline on Windows, let me know. 

2) Building PSPLINE
-------------------

You will need to build PSPLINE first. Download the code from 

$ wget http://w3.pppl.gov/rib/repositories/NTCC/files/pspline.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz pspline.tar.gz

You should get the directories pspline, ezcdf, portlib, include, fpreproc and share. Be sure to set

$ export FORTRAN_VARIANT=<your_compiler> 

if using bash shell, or

$ setenv FORTRAN_VARIANT <your_compiler>

if using csh. Here, <your_compiler> can be GCC, Intel, LaheyFujitsu, Portland, SUN, IRIX64, etc, gfortran
works fine on Linux. 

If you're using an unsupported compiler you may want to add an entry to the file share/Make.flags. 

If NetCDF is not in the standard location (/usr/local/) you may need to edit share/Make.local or specify
via the NETCDF_DIR variable. Example:

$ gmake all FORTRAN_VARIANT=GCC NETCDF_DIR=/home/research/pletzer/software/netcdf

This will create a directory

LINUX/lib 

or SUN/lib, SGI/lib, ... depending on your platform. Compilers are not discriminated so you will need to compile in different directories if you want to support several compilers, say on Linux. This is also true if you need to support both i686 and ia64.

3) Building PyPSPLINE

I recommend downloading pyspline *after* PSPLINE in a directory adjacent to pspline, ezcdf, etc (i.e. there should be no pypspline directory at his level when building PSPLINE). 

Go to this directory

$ cd pypspline

If you have a recent Python version installed on your system, you should not have to re-generate fpsplinemodule.c. 

Edit the top lines of the setup.py file. In particular, you will need to determine the Fortran libraries to provide to the C compiler, which are system dependent. Pypspline has been successfully built on Linux using the Intel, Lahey-Fujitsu and Portland Group compilers. 

Then type

$ python setup.py install

or if you don't have root permission

$ python setup.py install --prefix=<path>

Note: on some systems python is called python2.
